# AWS EC2 Security Group Update Script

This is a work in progress Security Group update script for dynamic IPs. This
is basically for the individual user who has a dynamic IP and already uses a
DDNS service to keep an A record updated with their IP, but could also be used
for businesses in unique cases. Either way, I needed this for myself so I 
figured I'd share it.
